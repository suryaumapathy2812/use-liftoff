1. update the demo page, to only have one list the primary category, (lets have it as a standalone json)
2. will be taking interview, presentation & speaking (will be removing general purpose)
3. each will have its own route in the app.

### Interview Route (we are only working on mocking the UI)
1. start page - will ask the user to upload her/his profile (as pdf), followed by start interview button
2. create a json matches our current agent json, (id, name, description, etc...)
3. /interview/reports page - will create a mock ui of the reports that will be generated after the interview.
4. reports page - 
- segment
    - candidate performance score (in number as percentage)
    - behavioural analysis (- emotional state in percentage, - confidence in percentage) - also a ui showing the overall percentage
    - Speech Analysis (-speaking in percentage, - listening in percentage, - proficiency in percentage) (also contain a overall radial chart - average of the all)
    - Field Knowledge Evaluation - radar chart ( understanding, applying, analysing )
    - Report Summary - write up about the interaction between the user and interviewer




### Presentation (yet to start)
